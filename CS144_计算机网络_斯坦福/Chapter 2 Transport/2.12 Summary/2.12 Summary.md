# 2.12 Summary

- TCP ,transmission Control Protocal,
  TCP almost universally used ,provides the reliable , end-to-end,byte suream service

- UDP ,user datagram protocal,
  used by applications that dont need the guaranteed delivery service of TCP,
  because the application handles retransmissions in its own private way,
  or because the application just doesn't need reliable delivery.

- ICMP,internet cantrol message protocol.
  is to send feedback if things going wrong.

- End to End Principle,
  1.the milder version says that there are some functions that can only be correctly implemented at the edges or
  fringe of the network
  2.stronger version says,if we can implement a funciton at the end hosts,then we should,
