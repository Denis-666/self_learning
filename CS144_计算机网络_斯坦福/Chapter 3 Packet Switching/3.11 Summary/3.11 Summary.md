# 3.11 Summary

## Packet switching

- the modern network are built on a foundation of packet switching

### Packet switching

- Simple : each packet is a self_contained unit of data!!!
- Efficient : keep the link busy.
- ootentially help the network recover quickly from failures: simple forwarding paradigm,with no per-flow state in each router

## packet switching determines

3 main delay

- the packetization delay

```
Packetization delays are caused by the amount of time it takes the endpoints packet with data to be used in voice services. In most cases, larger the packet size, greater the amount of time it takes to fill it. The codec standard used will govern the packetization delay.
```

- the propagation delay

```
Propagation delay is the time taken by the voice to travel length from one end point to another end point through the network. It induces a one-way delay of about 70–100 ms. This delay is almost imperceptible to human ear, and it along with handling delays can degrade the voice quality.
```

- the queueing delay

## rate and delay guarantees 就是 保证 速度 和 延迟

就是 那一章节，按权重分配流量
